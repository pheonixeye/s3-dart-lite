# API Reference

The full API reference is generated using `dart doc`.

If you are running the docs locally, you can view the API reference [here](../../doc/api/index.html) (path may vary based on serving method).

You can generate the latest API docs by running:

```bash
dart doc .
```

This will produce HTML documentation in the `doc/api` directory.
